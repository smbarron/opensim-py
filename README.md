A variety of scripts for batch processing using different pipelines in OpenSim. Also contains sample setup files for each individual processing script.

Overviews of each processing script are below - see the info strings at the top of the '.py' script files for additional usage information.

Note: These scripts were designed for use with the Thoracoscapular model, which can be found at https://simtk.org/projects/thoracoscapular.
